Requirements and systems:
(The following are required to have a full project as the code was specifically written to work with the following)
Components:
Arduino Mega 2560
Sparkfun Qwiic Mux
Sparkfun Qwiic White Alphanumeric display (quantity of 4)
Sparkfun Qwiic Big SerLCD
Sparkfun Qwiic 128x32 OLED
Sparkfun Qwiic OLED (official name coming soon)
Sparkfun Qwiic RTC
Sparkfun Qwiic NFC/RFID read and write tag
Sparkfun Qwiic MicroSD card read and writer
Sparkfun Qwiic micro tempature sensor
Buzzer (any kind works)
IR diode
IR sensor 
(jumper cables and qwiic cables are required)

Qwiic Breakdown:
Red: 3.3-5V
Black: GND
Yellow: SCL
Blue: SDA
(This will be plugged directly in to the arduino using the breadboard jumper to Qwiic cable and these ports can be found on the corner of the arduino by the button)
(Once plugged in, the Qwiic cable will plug into the Mux as shown above)

Mux(0-9):
[0]-Sparkfun Qwiic LCD
[1]-Sparkfun NFC
[2]-Sparkfun Temp
[3]-Sparkfun RTC
[4]-Sparkfun 128x32 OLED
[5]-
[6]-
[7]-
[8]-
[9]-

Alphanumeric:
[DIS1(0x70)]-[DIS2(0x71)]-[DIS3(0x72)]-[DIS4(0x73)]

Buzzer:
[PWR/INPUT]-Pin:-
[GND]-Pin:-

IR Sensor:

[GND]-Pin:-
[DATA]-Pin:-

IR Diode:
[PWR/INPUT]-Pin:-
[GND]-Pin:-



Program info:
This project will require a software bundled with the code for the arduino itself. The software can be found in the software file.
Once both are installed, they will work simultaneously. A computer is required. (Windows recommended)

This project is entirely open source for the pourpose of being able to create your own plugins for the software.
If an app is able to work with the software and you want to add support or features. You can create that at any time.
This project has no copyright limitations as related to code. You are allowed to modify the software at anytime without limitation.

NO OS OR SOFTWARE RELEASED YET BUT CURRENTLY TRYING MY HARDEST TO GET ONE OUT. (I still dont even have all the parts yet) But I can garuntee one is coming out soon.

More info coming soon...
