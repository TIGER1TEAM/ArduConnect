This is an arduino project as a little desktop LCD to interact with a computer software. (And wow we are excited to release this as their are so many opportunities for this) All software ideas are listed below. (These are only ideas, no guarantees) Youtube (with chrome extension coming soon), Corsair ICue, Razer Synapse, Razer Axon, Armory Crate (still in research), OBS, MSI Afterburner, (and any other software of your choice. just find or reaserch a plugin) This project will be able to interact with you computer audio levels and for an example, start recording while fixing your fan speed and even making sure to display the timecode of the youtube video that's currently playing. This project is going to be wildly overbuilt and ready for any plugin and app of your choosing. The device will contain menues and settings to let you interact with those apps kinda like a streamdeck but with a more media production baised functionality. I believe that this red cardboard box with a few displays and an IR remote function that's plugged into your computer can change your workflow. The parts, guides, and other info can be found in the other file showing the diagrams and other pices of information necessary for use. More updates coming soon including a full menue system and parts guide as well as functionality and pre-loaded apps.
